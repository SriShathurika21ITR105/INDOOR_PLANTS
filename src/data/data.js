It also prefers a bit more moisture than its spiky kin, so water whenever the top inch of soil is dry. Keep this cactus in bright light near a window and it should reward you by blooming in winter with showy pink blooms. If it blooms a little earlier than you expect and the stem segments are spiky instead of scalloped, you might actually have a Thanksgiving cactus , but do not worry the care instructions are similar for both.',

Both produce chicks small, identical plants that are slightly offset from the mother. Echeveria elegans forms flat, flowerlike rosettes with rounded edges and grows arching, bell shaped blooms every year. Sempervivum tectorum also forms rosettes, but each leaf tends to be flatter and more pointed. It has tiny, star-shaped flowers. Both of these succulents come in all sorts of varieties that offer interesting colors, so they are especially fun to collect.',

And while aloe vera might be most well-known for its healing sap used for centuries to treat wounds and sunburn, it does have sharp "teeth" along its leaf edges that can cut an unsuspecting passerby, so handle it with care. Aloe vera is a forgiving, easy-to-grow houseplant that is tough to kill. Like other succulents, it prefers being kept on the drier side and does best in bright light, though if you suddenly move it into a hot, sunny window, its leaves can get burned.',

Although the ponytail palm does not look much like a succulent, the swollen, bulbous base of the trunk (called a caudex) stores water and gives the plant its other common name: Elephant foot. Whatever you call it, its very adaptable to life as a houseplant but does best with bright light, warmer temperatures, and low humidity. Its the perfect houseplant for a neglectful gardener because it does not need much water, especially in the winter when it isnt actively growing.',
